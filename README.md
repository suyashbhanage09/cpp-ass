This C++ code defines a class called Car with three public attributes: brand, model, and year. 
In the main function, two objects of the Car class (carObj1 and carObj2) are created, and their attributes are assigned specific values. 
The code then prints the brand, model, and year of both car objects to the console. 
The cout statements display the details of the cars on separate lines.
